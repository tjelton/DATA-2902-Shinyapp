# DATA-2902-Shinyapp

This repository includes the report and Shiny app created for my first assignment in DATA2902. In particular, 
I put a lot of work into this Shiny (my first ever Shiny project), and was happy with how it turned out. 
I was also really proud that my report and Shiny were 1 of the 2 reports chosen to share with the cohort of around 750
students as exemplars.

## Data Set

The data set was created via a 'Google Forms' survey sent to students enrolled in DATA2901 and DATA2002. Questions tended to gather 
demographical information.

## Report

Data was analysed using 'R', and the report was written using 'R Markdown'. The report was knitted as a HTML document.

## Shiny App

The Shiny App code can be found in the 'Shiny-Code' folder.

The Shiny App can be accessed [here](https://thomaselton.shinyapps.io/assignment-1-inidivudal/). Please be aware that I am currently on
the free version of 'Shinyapps.io', and as such, all of my Shiny Apps combined cannot exceed 25 active hours a month.
